## How to play
Simple GUI on the website.
1) Press the a A key to start.
2) 1 of the four button will shine. You will need to click that button again to proceed to the next level.
3) On the next level, another button will shine. This time, to proceed, you need to click in the correct sequence from the start to the current level.
   For example: Level 1 is red. Level 2 is greem. Then click red then green to continue.
4) The game end when you cannot click the color sequence in the correct way.
HAPPY PLAYING
